# FixtureToFactory

Quick and dirty conversion from fixtures to factory girl factories.
It's just to save time if you have a bunch of fixtures you need to make factories out of.
The conversion is dumb so it just makes basic factories from the fixtures - basic value attributes. You can then copy/paste/alter the dumb factories into real ones!

Looks in ./test/fixtures and ./spec/fixtures

Output goes into ./test/factories or ./spec/factories
Output files look like generated_#{fixutre_name}.rb
